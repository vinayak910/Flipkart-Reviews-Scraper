Flipkart Customer,5,Great product,"Damn such a great phone. Camera is really good, battery lasts long enough, super smooth even though its just 60 hz XDR display. Videos with action mode on are insanely stable and crisp.The night mode can take some really good shots jn low light conditions .The whole apple environment itself is so seamless.

Avi thakur,5,Unsatisfactory,I don't know why people never talk about its heat issue.. i was Android user first time using iphone 14.. bro it heat like tawa when charging. And even normal use too. I was planning to buy Google 7 but then I saw so much user saying Google 7 have heat issue so I decided spend some more money go for iphone as lots of people never say any negative for iphone... Trust me I will never buy iPhone again...
